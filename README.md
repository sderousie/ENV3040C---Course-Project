# ENV3040C---Course-Project
Develop and test a hypothesis relevant to a problem in Environmental Engineering.
The supplemental figures are extra data that I found interesting and/or important for any future study of this topic. The necessary graphs for the assignmnet are in the main report.
Note: There is a red box on one of the additional files I am submitting. This is not a big issue, the data calculates any differences in the data and some of the data has zero difference and therefore the system "wilcoxonn" can't operate with a zero. However, none of the data is impacted by this.
